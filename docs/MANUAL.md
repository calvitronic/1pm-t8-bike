# Bike Map

# Target User Group
* UCSB students who regularly commute on campus seeking the best time to depart for each class

# Purpose
* THe UCSB Bike Map focuses on sharing new information about the bike paths in order to alert UCSB users on the optimal time for leaving to and from classes and make commuting feel more of a community. This app will display recent bike crashes that occur on the bike path in order to inform the user of potential delays in the daily commute on campus. It will also provide an estimated commute time between buildings and alert the user on the most optimal time for departure based on their user inputted schedule. There will also be a way to report lost/found items that were dropped while commuting.

# Product Features

## Map (Home Page)
* This is our Home Page and the first page that users will see when opening up our website.
* On this page, users will see a map, and above it 'Report Crash' and 'Call CSO' button. To the right of this, users can view their daily itinerary, which displays your upcoming class followed by an estimated travel time and a recommended time to leave based on whether you select 'I'm biking!' or 'I'm walking'. The default mode is set to biking and users may click 'Refresh' whenever they'd like to recieve the most recent time calculations. Below the upcoming class, users can view a list of their future classes that day followed by a list of already past classes. In order to fill your itinerary with classes, reference the schedule section of the profile page.
* The map will show all recent bike crashes and all bike racks on campus in the form of markers.
* When you click on the 'Report Crash' Button, it will create a new marker on the map.
* When you click on the 'Call CSO' Button, it will call CSO so as to request their help on campus.

## Lost and Found
* Here, users are able to view Lost/Found Items that were encountered around campus. Any Lost and Found post with an attached image will be displayed and all Lost and Found posts will display the title, author, short description, and time of posting. Clicking on a post will redirect you to the corresponding Forum post page where comments and responses may be made by other users.
* Lost and Found posts are capable of being closed by the user so that others can know that an item has been returned/found.
* Logged in users are able to create a new Lost and Found post and/or add comments to existing posts.

## Forum
* Here, this is a broader section of posts where users can discuss about anything related to commuting. This could include further discussions of specific crashes/incidents, announcements, or other off-topic conversations. Forums will also include the Lost and Found posts from the Lost and Found page.
* Logged in users are able to create a post and/or add comments to existing posts. The ability to edit/delete a post/comment is always available to the author, and similarly to the Lost & Found posts, the author may always change the status of a post from "OPEN" to "CLOSED" in order to notify other users.

## Profile
* Only logged in users can view this page, where personal information such as your name, email, and profile pic are displayed.
* On this page, users are able to add classes to their schedule and view their L&F/Forum post history. Any classes added to the schedule will appear within the daily itinerary on the Map (Home Page) whenever the user has class on that current day.
* Every class consists of a title, location (selected from a dropdown of all UCSB buildings), days of the week, as well as a start and end time.
* Users can also have their own 'bio' which they can edit.
