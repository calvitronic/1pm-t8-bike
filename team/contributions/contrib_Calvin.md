* Calvin: I feel as though my contribution graph accurately reflects the work I've done for this project. I focused on developing the full-stack functionalities for the Lost & Found page, which allow users to create/view posts about items lost on the bike paths, as well as the Profile page, which allows users to update their bio, add courses to their schedule, and view their history of posts.
