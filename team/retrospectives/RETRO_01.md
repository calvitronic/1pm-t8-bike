# Date of Retrospective: 04/20/21

* Led by: Rukmini Bapat
* Present: Rukmini, Anika, Calvin, Yvonne
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

What has worked well so far?:
* communicated very well, through discord/slack for planning meetings and giving updates
* good at compromising for what we need to do for the project/make adjustments to our requirements
* the team has been consistent with keeping the github updated and asking before pushing big changes to the main branch

What has not worked that well so far?:
* For our Monday meetings, we should get an agenda up so we have a list of what we need to cover during the meeting
* During the standups we can do a better job of reviewing what we've each done and what we should do next (be more specific)

Ideas and Actions:
* Start a Google Doc/Sheet to list out an agenda before each meeting outside of class
* Could have one more meeting throughout the week (~15 minutes) to check in since we are moving more towards software dev in the project
* Adding another weekly meeting can help eliminate blockers for any team member

* a goal: to start a Google doc for listing an agenda of things to talk about before starting our meeting
* a change:  Meet more times in the week for group updates and to eliminate blockers
* a measurement: A way to measure whether the above changes helped us achieve our goals is to see if we are able to make more progress with 
   respect to the kanban board. If we are able to check off more tasks on the board, it will measure our increase in group productivity in the next few weeks.
   This means we would also have to meet to discuss if we need to add more issues to the kanban board.
  
## Optional

* Make sure to revisit the retro notes if any of us needs to refer to any ideas we had during the retrospective

## Retro Assessment

For this first retrospective, I used the Quick Retrospective template from Atlassian. I asked everyone in the team what they thought had worked well and what needs to be improved from our last sprint, and everyone gave great action ideas for us to take to increase our productivity as a group. The retrospective went really well because all group members contributed their thoughts, and I was able to facilitate the retro well. To the next person leading a retro, I would advise them to always make sure to actively ask questions and engage the group so every member can contribute their ideas as much as possible.  

## Outcome

Scheduled an extra meeting on Wednesday wherein we added several new issues to the kanban, assigned everyone who was not already working on a task to an issue related to the development of our MVP, and moved in progress issues into the completed category upon filling out acceptance criteria and linking a merged pull request.
