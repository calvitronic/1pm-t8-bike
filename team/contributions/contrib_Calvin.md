I feel as though my contribution graph accurately reflects the work I've done for this project. My main focuses involved developing the full-stack functionalities for the Lost & Found page, which allow users to create/view posts related to items that may have gotten lost on the bike paths, as well as the Profile page, which allows users to update their bio, add courses to their schedule, and view their history of forum posts. In addition to these specific features, I set up the Google OAuth such that only users who belong to UCSB may log in to our app and access certain features. Finally, I collaborated with the rest of my team when developing the daily itinerary display feature on the Map page based on the courses you've added to your schedule from the Profile page, including the estimated travel time depending on if your walking or biking as well as the best time to leave for your upcoming class. Along with my other teammates, I actively participated in the daily scrum and other team meetings, updating documentation on our GitHub whenever possible and interacting with the Kanban board often.
