# Project: Gaucho Bike Map
Mentor: Vincent Tieu

Meeting Time: 6pm

Type of meeting: standup

Team:  Rukmini Bapat ✓, Yvonne Liu ✓, Calvin Dougher ✓, Anika Arora ✓

# Meeting Notes
* Yvonne: Made a post object and comments object and is able to add to the MongoDB database
* In order for everyone to work with MongoDB, we need everyone to create an account and whitelist their IP address
* Ideally everyone watches the MERN stack video to get up to speed by the end of the week
* Calvin: set up profile configurations, json file to handle the data --> will link with the Lost and Found
* Looked at itinerary to make an alert for a few minutes before the next passing period for classes 
* Anika: Leaflet map is working, figuring out how to get it embedded into our app, working with ULAs in office hours
* Planning to implement starting/stopping in the map and implement the Bike Layer on Leaflet
* Rukmini: Trying to get Google Maps working (will probably end up adding payment information) since Leaflet doesn't have an in-built bike layer functionality.
* Planning to help Yvonne with functionality for adding comments to array in MongoDB so forum will start storing all information necessary.
