My name is Yvonne Liu. I am a second year studying Computer Science. I enjoy watching tv shows and playing on my Nintendo Switch. I haven't really done a major project like this before so I'm excited to learn and gain some experience. :D

Ideas for the Bike Project:

-Implement a report feature that allows for users to report bike crashes that can then improve the map.
-Use a similar method to Google Maps whhen tracking traffic. It uses the user's phones to conclude the congestion of traffic.
-Start with a web application, but an app based approach would be more reasonable.
