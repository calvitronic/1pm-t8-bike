# Date of Retrospective: 05/25/21

* Led by: Anika Arora
* Present: Anika, Rukmini, Calvin, Yvonne
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

What was good: 
* Creating a priority list 
* Monday meetings 
* We always had something to show in meetings (always had updates for the team) 
* We developed a good amount of things and now we should just focus on making it easy for the user to use our app. 

What was bad: 
* We put down too many ideas initially that weren't doable in 10 weeks. 
* We finalized which map we were using really late. 
* Our issues were too big (should have split it up into smaller issues). 
* Didn't set up our database early on so we had to convert the hard-coded pages into the database. 

Ideas: 
* As we approach the end of development, we should increase how much we collaborate. Make sure everyone is on the same page and understands what they have to 
    do to get the specifications to work. 

Actions:
* Don't add new components or features until everything else is finished. 
* Updating the Kanban board more frequently to make sure everyone is working on something and is on the same page. 


* a goal: have alerting system implemented by Sunday --> use the last two weeks efficiently by having mini deadlines for small tasks 
* a change: constant communication with team as soon as you make some progress 
  
## Optional

* Make sure to revisit the retro notes if any of us needs to refer to any ideas we had during the retrospective
