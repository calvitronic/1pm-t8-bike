My name is Anika Arora. I'm a second year CS major. I enjoy reading, baking, playing video games, and playing the guitar. Here are some ideas I have for the project:

- if there's an accident or road block up ahead, notify the user and provide a different, faster option
- allow users to report incidents
- have a "lost-and-found" feature for bikers or pedestrians to add lost items found on the bike path
