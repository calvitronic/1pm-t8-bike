I feel that my contribution graph accurately represents the work I've done for this project. I set up the Node.js backend for the website, worked on integrating a Node.js wrapper for the Google Distance Matrix API so we could get the travel time between a user's current location and their next class, worked on styling the landing page features such as the navbar and the overall layout of the home page, contributed features towards the Google map on the home page, specifically adding a window to show infomration about a crash report, and helped with the About Us Page. In addition to my software development contributions, I participated in the group standups and updated the Github Kanban board whnever a new feature idea came up throughout the quarter. Overall, the graph shows the consistent manner in which I contributed towards the project.
