I feel that my contribution graph somewhat accurately represents the work I've done for this project. I focused on implementing the map 
and creating the markers on the map for the website. I also added all the pictures and team member information on the About us page. 
The one thing that may make the graph a little incorrect is that I also implemented a full, working map on leaflet on another branch
because we were planning on switching to leaflet. However, we eventually decided to switch back to google maps so my code was never merged to main. 
Other than that, however, I think my graph was pretty accurate for the most part.
