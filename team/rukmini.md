My name is Rukmini Bapat and I am a second year computer science student. I enjoy hiking, baking, and playing table-tennis. 
My ideas for the project:
- incorporate a feature that serves as a "lost and found" on the trail. I've noticed many students posting in Facebook groups about losing their airpods and other valuables like wallets/id cards and asking others who may be biking on the trail in the same day to alert them if they find the missing item.
- incorporate a feature that will track the most recent bike trip of the traveler, and will only publish the location if the student has lost an item and wants to alert the public about what their route was so others biking on the same route can find it.
- have a feature that alerts to the nearest open bike parking spot
