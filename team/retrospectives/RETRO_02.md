# Date of Retrospective: 05/07/21

* Led by: Calvin Dougher
* Present: Calvin, Rukmini, Anika, Yvonne
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

Start:
* Using feedback from the MVP demo in order to update our Kanban board accordingly
* Incorporating/assigning roles based on frontend/backend development, less on specific components of app
* Review Kanban board more often, updating issues based on acceptance criteria and completeness

Stop:
* Less branching out in terms of the breadth our app has to offer, focus more on the depth of each feature's functionality

Continue:
* Hosting meetings on Mondays in order to discuss our general plan for the week
* Keep each other updated via discord/slack based on our individual progress and/or any hiccups
* Friendly, open culture of communication

* a goal: Addressing the feedback and suggestions recieved from mentors and peers
* a change: Create some issues on the kanban board aiming to implement feedback and assign a team member
* a measurement: Reflect one of these issues within the next version of our app's deployment
  
## Optional

* Make sure to revisit the retro notes if any of us needs to refer to any ideas we had during the retrospective

## Retro Assessment

* For the second retrospective, I used the Start/Stop/Continue outline which is pretty self-explanatory in that we simply discuss norms/behaviors which we'd like to either start, stop, or continue doing as a team.
* This particular retrospective went very well, and I think the recent MVP demo played a big part in guiding the direction we want to to continue working toward with the development of our product. 
* In terms of advice I'd give to the next retrospective leader, I suggest choosing a simple outline and coming prepared with some ideas in order to facilitate discussion within the group at first.

## Retro Outcome Assessment

* Based on the last retrospective our team planned to address the feedback we recieved within the MVP demo.
* We chose to measure our outcome based on the progress of our kanban board, and whether we are able to label certain issues as "feedback"-related.
* The outcome according to this metric was beneficial in that we were able to move MVP issues into the done category and assigned everyone to a new "feedback"-related issue which is currently in progress.
* Based on this outcome, we plan to continue following a similar experiment, modified based on the feedback we recieve at the end of each sprint.
