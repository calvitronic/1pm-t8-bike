# Project: Gaucho Bike Map 
A map of UCSB's bike path that has features such as lost and found, forum, and crash reports. Users can request an estimated travel time to their destination and an optimal time for departure. Bikers are able to also see nearby available bike racks and report crashes. Walkers are able to view/report/claim lost and found items that are found on the bike paths.
