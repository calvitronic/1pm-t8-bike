I feel that the contribution graph accurately represents the work I've done for this project. For this project, I set up the database for your website using MongoDB Atlas. We used the database to store crash markers and their positions, bike racks and their positions, all the forum posts, and its corresponding comments, and the users that have logged into their Google account. For image storage, I set up Google Cloud Storage. I also set up the Forum Page and its components. Whenever a new issue appears, I try my best to update on the Kanban board and update my team about new features or changes that I have done.
