My name is Calvin Dougher. I'm currently a second year studying Computer Science. I enjoy exercising outdoors and I play for UCSB's Ultimate Frisbee team, Black Tide. Other than that I've been teaching myself how to play the guitar in my freetime over quarantine. I'm looking forward to being apart of one of my first large-scale group projects and hope to gain a lot of important experience during this quarter.  
Ideas:  
- Implement a graphical overlay superimposed on top of the bike path map indicating the relative levels of traffic congestion using a maps api perhaps.
- Given a lecture hall or any location on campus, the app could provide users with the optimal bike rack spot to park at in order to reduce walking distance.
- Be able to provide alternate routes in the case of a "traffic jam" or crash.
